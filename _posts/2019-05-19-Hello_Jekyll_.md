title: "Hello Jekyll!"

After a few issues with [Hubpress.io](https://github.com/HubPress/hubpress.io) (is it even maintained now?), I decided to migrate my blog again and move to Jekyll.

The process was a mix of automatic ([Pandoc](https://pandoc.org/)), semi-manual (helped with some good old Bash commands) and purely manual transformations. I even fixed old quirks from the previous Dotclear->Hubpress migration in the process.

The theme is used is well... minimal but I do not really need a fancy blog. I got rid of the analytics. I also added a mystery page.

Anyway, my blog is now live and usable again.

Stay tuned for an announcement I have been wanting to make for a while!

In the meantime, long live Jekyll!
