# AssertJ-Neo4j 1.0.0 is out!

Assertwhat?
~~~~~~~~~~~

AssertJ-Neo4j is an AssertJ module. AssertJ aims at making tests more
concise and readable, by providing a set of rich and broad assertions.
They are, at the time of writing, broken down into three modules:
* https://github.com/joel-costigliola/assertj-core[AssertJ-core]:
 assertions focused on JDK structures
* https://github.com/joel-costigliola/assertj-guava[AssertJ-Guava]:
assertions for some structures bundled with
https://code.google.com/p/guava-libraries/[Guava]
*
https://github.com/joel-costigliola/assertj-joda-time[AssertJ-Joda-Time]:
assertions for the Java http://www.joda.org/joda-time/[date and time
API] written by Stephen Colebourne

And affiliated with:
*
https://github.com/joel-costigliola/assertj-assertions-generator[AssertJ-generator-plugin]:
generate your own custom assertions! (check
https://github.com/joel-costigliola/assertj-assertions-generator-maven-plugin[the
Maven plugin] out!)
*
https://github.com/joel-costigliola/assertj-examples[AssertJ-examples]:
a project aggregating all modules and plugins, showing concrete examples
of use

This may seem familiar to some of you, for a reason. AssertJ is actually
a fork of Fest-Assert, initiated almost a year ago by
https://twitter.com/JoCosti[Joël Costigliola], long-time committer to
Fest-Assert. While it shares many similarities, AssertJ brings some
novelties as well.
Be sure to check the repositories and various examples on the Interwebz.

AssertJ-Neo4J!
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Neo4j embeds an
http://docs.neo4j.org/chunked/stable/tutorials-java-unit-testing.html["impermanent
graph database"] which definitely helps writing short and efficient
integration tests. However, there is still some boilerplate up to the
people to write. That's exactly
when https://github.com/joel-costigliola/assertj-neo4j[AssertJ-Neo4j] comes
to the rescue.
As you can see
from https://github.com/joel-costigliola/assertj-examples[AssertJ-examples],
Assert-Neo4j will help you write concise and elegant assertions on
http://api.neo4j.org/current/org/neo4j/graphdb/Node.html[Node],
http://api.neo4j.org/current/org/neo4j/graphdb/Relationship.html[Relationship] (and
their common part:
http://api.neo4j.org/current/org/neo4j/graphdb/PropertyContainer.html[PropertyContainer])
and http://api.neo4j.org/current/org/neo4j/graphdb/Path.html[Path].
Feel free to check the examples

While I already have some plans to provide better assertions on
collections of Node/Relationship, I am very eager to gather your
feedback on this.
Feel free to send suggestions on
https://github.com/joel-costigliola/assertj-neo4j/issues[Github] or ping
me on https://twitter.com/fbiville[Twitter]!

HAPPY NEW YEAR! :-)
