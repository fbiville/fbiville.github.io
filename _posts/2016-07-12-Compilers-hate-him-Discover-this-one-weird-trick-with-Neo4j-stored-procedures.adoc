# Compilers hate him! Discover this one weird trick with Neo4j stored procedures

As you probably already know, Neo4j 3.0 finally comes with https://neo4j.com/docs/java-reference/current/#_calling_procedure[stored procedures] (let's call them sprocs from now on).

The cool thing about this is you can directly interact with sprocs in Cypher, as https://twitter.com/mesirii[Michael Hunger] explains in this  https://neo4j.com/blog/intro-user-defined-procedures-apoc/[blog post].

## Writing stored procedures

During the preparation of my Neo4j in the latest https://www.facebook.com/GoCriteo/photos/pcb.1045385882181102/1045385698847787/?type=3[Criteo summit] (we're http://www.criteo.com/careers/#careers-browser[hiring]!), I started playing around with sprocs.

The process is quite simple:

 1. You write some code, annotate it
 2. test it with the test harness
 3. deploy it to your Neo4j instance and that's it!
