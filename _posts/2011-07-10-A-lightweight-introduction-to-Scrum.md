The presentation was actually quite short but there were a LOT of
questions afterwards. This has been a really interesting meeting and I
sincerely hope it will help the company to work in a better way.

I have decided to publish a public non-branded version of the slides [on
Slideshare](http://www.slideshare.net/fbiville/lightweight-introduction-to-scrum)
but you, as a lucky reader, can watch it below.

<iframe src="//www.slideshare.net/slideshow/embed_code/key/B6YNh5C5qEl8f2" width="595" height="485" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no" style="border:1px solid #CCC; border-width:1px; margin-bottom:5px; max-width: 100%;" allowfullscreen> </iframe> <div style="margin-bottom:5px"> <strong> <a href="//www.slideshare.net/fbiville/lightweight-introduction-to-scrum" title="Lightweight introduction to Scrum" target="_blank">Lightweight introduction to Scrum</a> </strong> from <strong><a href="//www.slideshare.net/fbiville" target="_blank">Florent Biville</a></strong> </div>

This can of course be enhanced so feel free to add comments about
improvements you might think useful.
