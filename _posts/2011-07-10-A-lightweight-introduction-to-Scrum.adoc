The presentation was actually quite short but there were a LOT of
questions afterwards. This has been a really interesting meeting and I
sincerely hope it will help the company to work in a better way.

I have decided to publish a public non-branded version of the slides
http://www.slideshare.net/fbiville/lightweight-introduction-to-scrum[on
Slideshare] but you, as a lucky reader, can watch it below.

This can of course be enhanced so feel free to add comments about
improvements you might think useful.
