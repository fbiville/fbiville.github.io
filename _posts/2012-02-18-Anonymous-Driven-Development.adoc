I think it is.

By the way, this was taken by http://blog.paumard.org/[Jos√© Paumard]
during the
http://www.parisjug.org/xwiki/bin/view/Blog/Les+photos+de+Code+Story[Java
User Group] session of February 2012, for
http://www.code-story.net/[Code Story] contest.
http://blog.piwai.info/[Pierre-Yves] (on the right, who directly
inspired me the title of this blog post) and I (on the left) ranked
second, just after Le Merdy brothers.

Imagine yourself live-coding in front of 180 people? You cannot? Well,
we probably wouldn't some time ago, but we did it and it was great!

Not only fun, this experience has been extremely fruitful: I greatly
improved my way of using Eclipse (learning shortcuts and using 'em
extensively, refactoring by extracts ...). So please, now, run to the
closest geek nest and attend some coding dojos!

And big big thanks again to http://blog.javabien.net/[David Gageot] and
http://morlhon.net/blog/[Jean-Laurent de Morlhon] for this wonderful
idea!
