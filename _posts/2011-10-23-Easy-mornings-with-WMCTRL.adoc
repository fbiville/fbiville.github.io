# Easy mornings with WMCTRL
Starting your IDE in workspace 2, opening a console in workspace 3, your
mail client in workspace 8, updating your project sources...

Well, it's time to automate this! And the solution is easy:
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wmctrl[WMCTRL]. This awesome command-line
tool gives you control on your windows (move 'em, resize 'em).

When I found this utility more than a year ago, I decided to use it in a
small script that launches my daily apps and moves their windows to the
appropriate workspaces. You can find it
https://gist.github.com/1306553[here]. You just need to include it in
your startup applications and you are all done!Â 

Each time Ubuntu starts, so do your applications :)

You can now enjoy your coffee during these sacred saved minutes.
