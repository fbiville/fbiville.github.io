title: "Easy Mornings With WMCTRL"
---
Well, it's time to automate this! And the solution is easy:
[WMCTRL](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wmctrl). This awesome command-line
tool gives you control on your windows (move \'em, resize \'em).

When I found this utility more than a year ago, I decided to use it in a
small script that launches my daily apps and moves their windows to the
appropriate workspaces. You can find it
[here](https://gist.github.com/1306553). You just need to include it in
your startup applications and you are all done!Â 

Each time Ubuntu starts, so do your applications :)

You can now enjoy your coffee during these sacred saved minutes.
