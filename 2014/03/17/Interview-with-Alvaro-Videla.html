<p><strong>Alright-o, let&#8217;s start. Who are you, Alvaro? What is your main
occupation? And most importantly, why do you change your family name so
often on Twitter?</strong></p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>My name is Alvaro Videla, I go online as
<a href="https://twitter.com/old_sound">@old_sound</a> on Twitter and
<a href="https://github.com/videlalvaro">videlalvaro</a> on Github. I work as a
Developer Advocate for <a href="https://www.rabbitmq.com/">RabbitMQ</a>. While most
people would think that I&#8217;m just another marketing guy, my actual
occupation is about making RabbitMQ easier to use. That might be from
writing a blog post about a particular feature, to improve an existing
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Advanced_Message_Queuing_Protocol">AMQP</a>
client so users have a happier path to adopting RabbitMQ. I also commit
stuff from time to time to the core parts of the broker.
You can also find me giving talks at several conferences around the
world. My goal is to make RabbitMQ well known at different developer
communities, showing the different things that can be done with
RabbitMQ.
My twitter name changes usually reflect situations that I&#8217;ve found
funny/interesting and that I want to mock. Videlustig was a "funny" one.

<p><strong>What has motivated your career changes (leaving Uruguay&#8230;&#8203;)?</strong>
*<br>
*
With my wife we wanted to travel the world. Moving to China, the
antipode of Uruguay seemed like a good place to start, so I searched for
a job in Shanghai. After I&#8217;ve got the job, we quit our jobs in Uruguay,
packed our things, and moved to Shanghai. After three years we moved to
Switzerland. It was already enough time in China and we wanted to see
what this Europe thing was all about. Little did we know that
Switzerland is not part of Europe, but some Island in the middle of the
Alps! Still, it pretty much looks like Europe so we are happy with our
decision to move here.

<p><strong>How does working full-time for a worldwide company on an open source
product differ from your previous experiences?</strong>
*<br>
*
The main difference would be that here we are not working under the
pressure of delivering feature after feature as would happen with a web
agency for example. Here we can stop an try to build the things the best
as possible. That means I could go and get up to date with the research
say in data structures for fast routing, because at the end, if I add a
new routing algorithm to RabbitMQ, it has to be as fast as possible. So
getting this advantage means we get to learn a lot, to experiment a lot
which results in shipping good software. Of course we are not going to
spend one year reading about routing algorithms, there has to be a
balance where we actually ship working code.
Another interesting thing is that we have the pressure to deliver a
product with as less bugs as possible, since many people is using
RabbitMQ in mission critical scenarios. This means our code review
protocols are quite strict, we give a lot of feedback to each others,
and we don&#8217;t rush to merge things until they are ready.
Also since the broker supports so many programming languages and
environments, you get to learn a lot about different technologies.

<p><strong>Lately, you seem to have focused a lot on books related to mathematics
and Comput(er|ing) Science. Can you tell us a bit more?</strong>
*<br>
*
Since I started to study some algorithms, I kept seeing here and there
that the algorithms were "proved to work" with something the author was
calling "maths". So I decided to start learning. I already had
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Art_of_Computer_Programming">TAOCP</a> at
home, so it was time to take on the
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Knuth">Knuth</a> and learn what this
computer science was all about. One thing led to the next and I ended up
quite interested about Number Theory and Computation, specifically the
ideas behind Computational Group Theory (CGT) and Prime Numbers and
Computation.
I&#8217;ve planned to write about it on my blog here:
<a href="http://videlalvaro.github.io/" class="bare">http://videlalvaro.github.io/</a>
If someone&#8217;s interested, I recommend these two books on the topic:
This one is written by former Apple&#8217;s chief cryptographer and Mr.
Pomerance, who&#8217;s an authority in Number Theory:
Prime Numbers: A Computational Perspective:
<a href="http://www.amazon.com/Prime-Numbers-A-Computational-Perspective/dp/0387252827/" class="bare">http://www.amazon.com/Prime-Numbers-A-Computational-Perspective/dp/0387252827/</a>
Then this one is about Group Theory:
Handbook of Computational Group Theory:
<a href="http://www.amazon.com/Handbook-Computational-Discrete-Mathematics-Applications/dp/1584883723/" class="bare">http://www.amazon.com/Handbook-Computational-Discrete-Mathematics-Applications/dp/1584883723/</a>
The good thing about these two topics is that they are related to
Cryptography, so if you want to learn the maths behind, say
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Advanced_Encryption_Standard">AES</a> or
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RSA_(cryptosystem)">RSA</a>, then these books
are great. Also, you are learning an area of maths that have direct
application in day to day computing.

"liberté, égalité, fraternité, diversité" or much better "La Suisse est
